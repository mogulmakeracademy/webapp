```

2. Visit: https://mrmogulmaker.com/products-list-3123
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Refresh page
5. You should see the headline at the top!

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Headline not showing?**
- Make sure you saved the page in GHL
- Clear browser cache
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

**"BUILD" not yellow?**
- Verify "BUILD" is wrapped in `<strong>` tags
- Check that CSS is applied (see main instructions)
- Try adding HTML version with explicit styling

**Headline not centered?**
- CSS should handle this automatically
- If not, add class name to match CSS selectors

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

The CSS targets multiple class names:
- `.main-heading`
- `.hero-title`
- `.page-heading`
- `.store-heading`

If your headline doesn't have any of these classes, either:
1. Add the class name in GHL
2. Use the Custom HTML method above

1. ✅ Add headline text to GHL store (Method 1, 2, or 3)
2. ✅ Make "BUILD" bold
3. ✅ Apply CSS (from main instructions)
4. ✅ Test and verify

**That's it! Your headline will match your brand perfectly.** 🎉
