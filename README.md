## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes

### v2.9.5 - iOS Mobile Menu Fix (Jan 26, 2025)
**Problem:** Mobile menu not opening on iPhone (iOS Safari) for Speaking, Blog, and Shop pages, while Homepage worked fine.

**Root Cause:** Different JavaScript patterns between Homepage (working) and other pages (not working).

**Solution:** Copied the exact Homepage mobile menu implementation to all pages:
- ✅ Removed `touchstart` events (were causing conflicts)
- ✅ Removed iOS-specific CSS (`touch-manipulation`, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`)
- ✅ Added icon toggling (hamburger ↔ X when menu opens/closes)
- ✅ Added `body overflow: hidden` when menu is open (prevents background scroll)
- ✅ Used separate `openMobileMenu()` and `closeMobileMenu()` functions instead of toggle
- ✅ Added escape key handler to close menu
- ✅ Simplified button HTML to match Homepage exactly

**Key Learning:** The Homepage used a cleaner, more standard approach (click events only, no touchstart) that worked better on iOS. Adding iOS-specific "fixes" actually made it worse!
